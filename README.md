scSniper introduces a novel approach to biomarker discovery, leveraging deep neural network sensitivity analysis to pinpoint key gene biomarkers beyond traditional differential expression methods. It stands out by utilizing a mimetic attention mechanism, which allows for the integration of multi-omic data, highlighting critical biomarkers across genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. This mechanism prioritizes important multi-omic features, enabling a comprehensive analysis that other single-omic focused tools may miss.The tool innovatively merges a disease classifier and an autoencoder, producing joint cell embeddings that represent disease-specific multi-omic profiles, improving single-cell resolution clustering and biomarker identification accuracy. scSniper's method represents a significant leap in biomarker discovery, offering a more integrative and precise approach to understanding complex diseases.
